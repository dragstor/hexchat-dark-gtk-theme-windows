![Dark theme preview](https://i.imgur.com/XngWiY3.png)
Heads up! This theme is actually a [Layan GTK Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Layan-gtk-theme), so all credits for its beauty and hard work goes to them :shipit: 😍🎈🙌🏼

# :confused: How to "install"?

1. Navigate to `C:\Program Files\HexChat\share\themes\MS-Windows\gtk-2.0` (path might be different?)
2. **Backup your current `gtkrc` file!!!**
3. Seriously, do it.
4. Exit HexChat, if it's running.
5. Copy all files from this repo and paste them in `gtk-2.0` folder *(you're there, right?)*
6. ???
7. Run HexChat
8.

# :framed_picture:  An Actual Color Theme
I prefer using dark themes in general, so I recommend using the official "Smog" color theme. "Smog" and many others can be downloaded from here 👉🏼 https://hexchat.github.io/themes.html
